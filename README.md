# Video Face Recognition
This project will detect faces in a video file. Through the ability of deep learning, you can train the model with your own custom dataset to detect and recognize faces.

## 1. Prerequisites
- Numpy v.1.19
- PyTorch v.1.6.0
- CUDA 10.2 (optional for GPU training)
- ffpyplayer (optional for audio playback)
- Obtain your own dataset (Twitter Media Downloader)

## 2. Usage
1. Run Twitter Media Downloader
2. Open playground.ipynb
3. Change the hyperparameters if necessary, run
4. Repeat until you get the best result
